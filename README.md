#  The linear–quadratic regulator and Koopman Observable Subspaces

This repository contains two notebooks illustrating the linear–quadratic regulator
and the idea behind the Koopman operator.

Part I gives the intuitions for the linear–quadratic regulator framework and
solves for the optimal controller in Python. Part II introduces the Koopman
operator and discusses how a new (better) controller can be obtained compared
to Part I.
